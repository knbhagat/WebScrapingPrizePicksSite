# WebScrapingPrizePicksSite
During this project, I used an extension of NodeJS called Puppeteer to webscrape data including leagues, stats, and over/unders of players in order to look at betting lines or odd corresponding to those specific player props
In other words, I scraped the website to allow me to see all the players on the site with their betting lines to get an advantage on whose lines are set higher or lower compared to other books, giving an advantage when betting
